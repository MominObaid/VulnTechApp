**VulnTechApp**

VulnTechApp is a modern Android application designed as a mobile client for the VulnTech cybersecurity Capture The Flag (CTF) platform.

It provides users with a clean, mobile-friendly interface to browse and view Courses and manage their profiles.

The app is built using modern Android development practices, including Kotlin, View Binding, and the Jetpack Navigation Component.



**Features**


•_Browse Home page_: View a list of available courses, including details like enroll courses, about us, website visits.

•_Dynamic UI_: The interface uses a RecyclerView to efficiently display a dynamic list of challenges.

•_Modern Navigation_: A BottomNavigationView allows for easy switching between the app's main sections (Home, Library, Courses, Community).

•_Loading Indicators_: Simulates network loading with progress bars for a better user experience.

•_Single-Activity Architecture_: Built around a single MainActivity hosting multiple fragments, which is a best practice for modern Android apps.

•_Frontend First_: Developed with a "frontend-only" approach using mock data, making the UI independent and easily testable





**Future Work**

•[ ] Implement ViewModel and LiveData/StateFlow to manage UI state.

•[ ] Connect to a real backend API (e.g., using Retrofit) to fetch live data.

•[ ] Add a local database (e.g., using Room) for offline caching.

•[ ] Flesh out the Scoreboard, Profile, and About screens with real functionality.

•[ ] Write unit and UI tests
